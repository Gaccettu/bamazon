Welcome to the bamazon app. This app provides a node interface to selecting and purchasing products from the bamazon marketplace.

Please make sure you install inquirer and mysql before running the application.

After initializing the application bamazon presents you with a list of all of the products to buy and a list of all 10 products.

After selecting the product you are then asked how much of the product you want to buy.

If amount you buy is equal to or less than the stock you are notified your purchase was successful, the database is then updated to reflect the new amount of stock. If the amount you chose to purchase was greater than the stock your purchase fails and you are notified of the existing stock.

After both actions you're prompted to purchase again.
